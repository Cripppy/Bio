                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">There are two methods of reproduction:<em> sexual and asexual reproduction</em>. Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent because the offspring are all clones of the original parent. Asexual reproduction usually occurs in <strong>prokaryotic microorganisms </strong>(bacteria). Species reproduce asexually through budding, fission, fragmentation, or parthenogenesis. Sexual reproduction produces offspring with different genetic make-up. This can be an adaptive advantage in unstable or unpredictable environment. <strong>Protists</strong> reproduce sexually through gene transfer by conjugation and alternation of generations.&nbsp;<br><br>There are an estimated 390, 900 plant species that are known to science. In plants, the sexual reproduction is carried out in the flowers that contain the sexual organs. Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the male anther of one flower to the female stigma of another. A plant can be wind-pollinated, water-pollinated, insect-pollinated and other animal pollinators. Pollinators are very important to our food supply because they pollinate plants that are responsible for bringing us one of every three bites of food. After the occurrence of pollination, fertilization occur.<br><br>In animals, we classify them into three groups. <strong>Oviparous </strong>animals are animals that are born from an egg like snakes, birds, insects, and frogs. <strong>Viviparous </strong>animals are animals that are born from the mother's womb like elephants, horses, sharks, dogs, or even us! <strong>Ovoviviparous</strong> animals are animals that develop eggs inside their mother like seahorses, platypus and white shark.<br><br><br><br><br></p>

                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The male reproductive system is located in the <em>pelvis</em> region. It includes a pair of <strong>testes</strong> along with <strong>accessory duct glands</strong> and the <strong>external genitalia</strong>. It consists of a pair of testes lodged in an integumentary pouch -<em> scrotum</em>. Initially they are abdominal, however as the development proceeds they descend down into the scrotum. This adaptation enables regulation of internal temperature of the testes higher than body temperature which is essential for their normal functioning.<br><br>In adults, each testis is oval in shape, with a length of about 4 to 5 cm and a width about 2 to 3 cm. Testis is covered by a dense covering, each testis has about 250 compartments called testicular lobules. Each lobule contains one to three highly coiled <strong>seminiferous tubules </strong>inwhich sperms are produced. Many such seminiferous tubules after exit again from a complex network of tubular system known as <strong>Rete-Testis</strong>. Small ducts from rete-testis again unite to form a large convoluted duct called as <strong>epididymis</strong>, in which sperms are stored. Epididymis continues into <strong>vas deferens</strong> which carry sperms away from the testis.&nbsp;<br><br>Vas deferens after curving back over lower abdominal area enlarge to form <em>Ampulla</em>, in which opens a coiled tube with sacculated walls; this is the <em>Seminal Vesicle</em>. It is supposed to perform nutritive function by providing fructose and other nutrients to maintain vitality of sperms. By the union of seminal vesicular ducts and vas deferens, a short canal is formed. It is called as <strong>ejaculatory duct</strong> which further unites with the ureter to form a common passage-the urethra, which opens to outside of the body through the penis.<br><br>Seminiferous tubule is lined on its inside by <strong>Sertori cells </strong>that provide nutrition to the germ cells. Outside of seminiferous tubules are called interstitial spaces that contain small blood vessels and <strong>Leydig cells</strong>. Leydig cells synthesize and secrete testicular hormones called <em>androgens</em>. There are two glands - <strong>prostate and bulbourethral glands</strong> - that open into the urethra. They produce mucus that lubricates the urethra to facilitate the ejaculation of sperms during copulation. The secretion of these two glands constitute to the seminal plasma which is rich in fructose, calcium, and certain enzymes.&nbsp;<br><br>External genitalia organ in male is <strong>penis</strong> through which urethra runs. It is an erectile organ that has many nerve endings causing it to be sensitive to stimulation. Penis also helps in <em>sperm deposition</em> in the vagina during intercourse.</p>

                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>Before moving on to the process of fertilization, we need to understand the place where this takes place. Yes, I am referring to the<strong> female reproductive system</strong>, the site of <em>ovum production, fertilization, and the uterus</em> are all&nbsp;parts of the female reproductive system.<br><br>We began studying the male reproductive system from the site of sperm production which is the testes, similarly, we will begin learning from the site of production of the egg cells - the<strong> ovum</strong>. So the journey begins from these oval structures called the <strong>ovaries</strong> with one ovary on either side. As we noticed that the ovaries are connected to two black structures but not directly connected to it, looking carefully we find that there are finger-like projections which connect these two. These <em>finger-like projections</em> are very important for receiving the ovum when released from the ovaries and they do have a scientific name! These are called <strong>fimbriae</strong> that helped to hold the ovum released and also helped to sweep it to the tubes present ahead, but why does the ovum require the sweeping activity? Can it travel on its own? No, it can't. Unlike the motile sperm, the ovum is<em> non-motile</em>. It cannot move until it is pushed or swept by some other cells. Now, the two black structures that we have been referring to before are called <strong>fallopian tubes</strong>.<br><br>What do you think will be the importance of fallopian tubes? Is it that they connect the ovaries to the uterus? Indeed, it is definitely one important function but more important than this is that the fallopian tubes are the <em>site of fertilization</em>. It is where the sperms are able to fertilize the ovum and from here the zygote starts dividing and grows into an embryo. Now, where will this embryo go further? Needless to write, the uterus. We know that the <strong>uterus</strong>, commonly referred to as the <em>womb</em>, is the site of development of a baby and when the growth of the baby is completed, it comes out of the mother's body through the vagina.<br><br> We know that the <strong>vagina</strong> is basically a small passage that opens to the exterior. It is the site where <em>sperms</em> are received in the female's body. On the other hand, the same passage is used for passing the baby out of the body during childbirth. Now, that you've learned both the reproductive systems, can you think which one is more complex than the other one? If you think that it is the male reproductive system, you are wrong.&nbsp;<br><br>The<strong> female reproductive system </strong>is designed for the <em>complete process of fertilization</em> as well as the growth and the development of the baby. That is the reason why it is slightly more complex and complicated compared to the male reproductive system.<br><br>This is just an overview of how a female reproductive system is. We would get to know how every organ in the system works efficiently when we understand the process of fertilization and the development process of the embryo in detail.<br><br></p>
